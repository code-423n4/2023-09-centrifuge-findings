Protocol is using version 0.8.21 of solidity but arbitrum only fully supports up to version 0.8.19 ([Arbitrum documentation](https://docs.arbitrum.io/solidity-support)). Protocol team has indicated that they haven't decided which chains they will deploy to but have specified that they plan to deploy to most EVM chains. In order to deploy to Arbitrum the solidity version will have to be changed to 0.8.19.
