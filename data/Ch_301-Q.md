## Summary

### Low Risk Issues
01- The Invest could get blacklisted in the supported currency 
02- The `UserEscrow.transferOut()` will revert
03- Liquidity Pool is not ERC-4626 compatible contract
04- The tokens could have a different decimal in each chains
05- User could lose his Tranch tokens
06- The deployer could set `delay` to a value bigger than `MAX_DELAY` (4 weeks)
07- The admin could restart the scheduled delay period
08- No need for full allowance in case `transferOut()` get triggered by  `LiquidityPool.withdraw()` with a different  `receiver`

## Low Risk Issues

### 01- The Invest could get blacklisted in the supported currency 
in case `_currency == USDT` and `user` is blacklisted the transactions from Centrifuge chains will keep ever. and AXELAR will keep charging this protocol fee for every transaction 

```solidity
File: InvestmentManager.sol
SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(_currency, address(escrow), user, currencyPayout);

```

### 02- The `UserEscrow.transferOut()` will revert

In case `lpValues.maxWithdraw < _currency` is true and there are not enough  funds in `UserEscrow.sol`, the `UserEscrow.transferOut()` will revert  

```solidity
File: InvestmentManager.sol

        if (lpValues.maxWithdraw < _currency) {
            lpValues.maxWithdraw = 0;
        } else {
            lpValues.maxWithdraw = lpValues.maxWithdraw - _currency;
        }
        if (lpValues.maxRedeem < trancheTokens) {
            lpValues.maxRedeem = 0;
        } else {

```

### 03- Liquidity Pool is not ERC-4626 compatible contract
from README.md
```
Liquidity Pool: A ERC-4626 compatible contract that enables investors to deposit and withdraw stablecoins to invest in tranches of pools.
``` 
However, the `totalSupply()` will return the supply of all the Liquidity Pools that are with the same Tranch Token. It should return only the supply of the current Liquidity Pools

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256) {
        return share.totalSupply();
    }

```
*GitHub*: [L283-L285](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge/blob/main/src/LiquidityPool.sol#L283-L285)

### 04- The tokens could have a different decimal in each chain.

Because some tokens have a different decimal in a different chain
So, in case `currencyAddress` has a different decimal in the Centrifuge Chain. the same thing with `handleTransfer()` it just takes `amount` and transfers it to the `recipient`

```solidity
File: PoolManager.sol

    function transfer(address currencyAddress, bytes32 recipient, uint128 amount) public {
        uint128 currency = currencyAddressToId[currencyAddress];
        require(currency != 0, "PoolManager/unknown-currency");

        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(currencyAddress, msg.sender, address(escrow), amount);
        gateway.transfer(currency, msg.sender, recipient, amount);
    }

```
*GitHub*: [L128-L134](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge/blob/main/src/PoolManager.sol#L128-L134)

### 05- User could lose his Tranch tokens
In case the user passes a non-supported `destinationChainId` in `transferTrancheTokensToEVM()`. he will lose his funds 

```solidity
File: PoolManager.sol

    function transferTrancheTokensToEVM(
        uint64 poolId,
        bytes16 trancheId,
        uint64 destinationChainId,
        address destinationAddress,
        uint128 amount
    ) public {
        TrancheTokenLike trancheToken = TrancheTokenLike(getTrancheToken(poolId, trancheId));
        require(address(trancheToken) != address(0), "PoolManager/unknown-token");

        trancheToken.burn(msg.sender, amount);
        gateway.transferTrancheTokensToEVM(
            poolId, trancheId, msg.sender, destinationChainId, destinationAddress, amount
        );
    }
```

### 06- The deployer could set `delay` to a value bigger than `MAX_DELAY` (4 weeks)

The deployer could set `delay` to a value bigger than `MAX_DELAY` (4 weeks)

```solidity
File: Root.sol

    constructor(address _escrow, uint256 _delay) {
        escrow = _escrow;
        delay = _delay;

```
*GitHub*: [L34-L36](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge/blob/main/src/Root.sol#L34-L36)


### 07- The admin could restart the scheduled delay period

admin could invoke `scheduleRely()` function two times for the same `target`. this will restart the scheduled delay period that was passed

```solidity
File: Root.sol

    function scheduleRely(address target) external auth {
        schedule[target] = block.timestamp + delay;
        emit RelyScheduled(target, schedule[target]);
    }
```
*GitHub*: [L65-L68](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge/blob/main/src/Root.sol#L65-L68)


### 08- No need for full allowance in case `transferOut()` get triggered by  `LiquidityPool.withdraw()` with a different  `receiver`

users don't need to set any allowance or full allowance to invoke `LiquidityPool.withdraw()` with a different  `receiver`

```solidity
File: UserEscrow.sol

            receiver == destination || (ERC20Like(token).allowance(destination, receiver) == type(uint256).max),
            "UserEscrow/receiver-has-no-allowance"

```
