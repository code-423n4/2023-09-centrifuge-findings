# [A-01] Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

Accordingly, I analyzed and audited the subject in the following steps;

1.  **Core Protocol Contract Overview**:

    - **LiquidityPool.sol**: This contract is an ERC-4626 compatible contract that enables investors to deposit and withdraw stablecoins. These stablecoins are invested in tranches of pools, where users receive shares representing their ownership in these pools.

    - **InvestmentManager.sol**: Main contract LiquidityPools interact with for both incoming and outgoing investment transactions.

    - **PoolManager.sol**: Manages which pools & tranches exist. The contract is management point for various operations, allowing the addition of pools, tranches, currencies, and handling of token transfers between different systems.

    - **Escrow.sol**: This Escrow contract serves a basic role in allowing certain addresses (wards) to approve the spending of tokens held in escrow.

    - **UserEscrow.sol**: Token holding contract with locked destinations.

    - **Root.sol**: The Root contract that manages permissions, pausing, and timelocked actions. It also provides a mechanism to grant and revoke ward permissions on external contracts.

    - **admins/PauseAdmin.sol**: Simple pausing contract.

    - **admins/DelayedAdmin.sol**: Admin contract that can trigger the timelock on Root.

    - **token/Tranche.sol**: Tranche Token contract extends the ERC20 and ERC1404 standards to provide additional functionality related to tranche tokens. It allows for the management of liquidity pools and the imposition of transfer restrictions based on rules defined by the restrictionManager.

    - **token/ERC20.sol**: ERC20 implementation with mint/burn & permit functionality.

    - **token/RestrictionManager.sol**: ERC1404 based contract that checks transfer restrictions.

    - **gateway/Gateway.sol**: Incoming & outgoing message parsing.

    - **gateway/Messages.sol**: This Library defines a standardized way to encode and decode messages for interacting with that system's contracts. The messages to be related to some operations, such as adding currencies, managing pools, and executing various transactions.

    - **gateway/routers/axelar/Router.sol**: Routing contract that integrates with Axelar.

    - **util/Auth.sol**: Simple authentication contract.

    - **util/Context.sol**: ERC2771 base contract.

    - **util/Factory.sol**: Factory contract for deploying LPs and tranche tokens.

    - **util/SafeTransferLib.sol**: The library is designed to enhance the safety of token transfers in contracts by checking for errors and ensuring that the transfers are executed correctly.

2.  **Documentation Review**:

    1. **Centrifuge**: Centrifuge is a blockchain-based platform that enables decentralized financing for real-world assets, such as mortgages and invoices. It eliminates the need for multiple intermediaries, making financing more accessible and affordable, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Centrifuge's native token, CFG, is used for governance, and assets are tokenized as NFTs, increasing transparency. The protocol integrates with DeFi platforms and aims to create a transparent and efficient financial system.
    2. **Tokenization and private data sharing**: Centrifuge uses tokenization to represent real-world assets as NFTs on the blockchain. However, some asset data needs to remain private. To address this, Centrifuge introduces the Private Data Layer. This layer allows asset issuers and investors to securely access additional asset data while keeping it confidential. This data is hashed and anchored on-chain, creating a secure link to the NFT without revealing the data publicly. The Private Data Layer operates through a network of nodes called PODs, enabling controlled access to asset information, making it useful for various use cases, including institutional investors and third-party valuations.

    3. **overview of Centrifuge Pools**:

       1. **Centrifuge Pool**: A Centrifuge pool is a DeFi platform that connects Asset Originators and investors.
          Asset Originators can tokenize real-world assets like invoices, mortgages, or royalties and use these NFTs as collateral in Centrifuge pools to access crypto investments.

       2. **Revolving Pool**: Centrifuge pools are set up as revolving pools, allowing investors to lock investments and redemptions at any time. A decentralized solver mechanism matches investments and redemptions to maintain risk metrics while ensuring liquidity for Asset Originators and flexibility for investors.

       3. **Entities Involved**:

          Issuer: A legal entity (often a special purpose vehicle or SPV) that manages assets, issues tokens, and legally oversees the pool.

          Asset Originator: The entity that originates real-world assets and uses them as collateral in the pool. There can be multiple Asset Originators for a single pool.

          Investors: Provide liquidity to the pool and earn yields and CFG rewards. They can invest in different tranches of the pool.

       4. **Tranche Tokens**: Centrifuge pools offer one to five tranches to cater to investors' risk preferences.
          Tranches include Senior tokens (yield tokens), Mezzanine tokens, and Junior tokens with varying risk and return profiles.
          Senior tokens offer stable but lower returns, while Junior tokens offer higher but more volatile returns.

       5. **Assets on Centrifuge**: Assets are real-world assets with stable values or payment streams used as collateral.
          These assets are tokenized as NFTs following the ERC-721 standard on Ethereum.

       6. **Financing**: Issuers lock NFTs as collateral in Centrifuge pools and draw financing against them.
          Financing incurs interest at a financing fee, which is expressed as an APR.
          To close financing, the entire outstanding amount (including accrued interest) must be repaid.

       7. **Asset Value / NAV (Net Asset Value)**: The NAV reflects the present value of outstanding financings, including the pool's reserve. It's calculated at every Epoch (a defined period) and determines token prices.

       8. **Investments and Redemptions**: Investors lock stablecoins (investment) or tokens (redemption) into the pool's smart contract. These orders are executed at the end of an Epoch. Orders can be partially executed, and remaining assets are kept in the contract for future execution.

       9. **Epochs**: Epochs are defined periods during which investment and redemption orders are locked and then executed.
          A solver mechanism optimizes order execution while adhering to risk metrics and priorities.

       10. **Pool Liquidity**:

           Reserve: The pool's liquidity available for redemptions and originations.

           Cash Drag: Excess liquidity in the reserve doesn't earn interest.

           MAX Reserve Amount: The issuer can set a limit on the maximum reserve.

       11. **Tranche Investment Capacity**:

           Indicates how much capacity is left for additional investments.

           Can be limited by the issuer's max reserve and tranche subordination ratios.

       12. **Oversubscribed Pools**: Pools may become oversubscribed, preventing additional investments if the reserve exceeds a limit or the senior subordination ratio is at its maximum.

       13. **Centrifuge Interest Rates, Fees, and Yields**:

           Financing Fee: Interest rate applied to outstanding asset financing.

           Senior Token APR: Interest rate for Senior tokens.

           Junior Token Return: Driven by spreads between financing rates and Senior token APRs.

           CFG Rewards: Daily rewards in Centrifuge's native token (CFG) for investors.

       14. **Risk and Pricing**:

           Current Subordination: Protects senior tranches against defaults.

           Min Subordination Ratio: Sets a lower limit to ensure senior investor protection.

    4. **Introduction to Tiered Investment Structures**: Tiered investment structures involve the use of different tranches in asset pools to customize the risk-return profile for various types of investors.
       In standard investment vehicles, investors usually share equal risk and return proportionate to their investment. However, tiered structures allow for different risk and return profiles within the same pool.
       While there can be many tranches, common structures have 2-5 tranches, including senior, mezzanine, and junior tranches.

       1. **The Waterfall**: In a tiered structure, tranches are organized in a waterfall fashion, with senior tranches at the top and junior tranches at the bottom.
          The senior tranche is the most secure, receiving proceeds first and being protected against defaults by tranches below it.
          The remaining proceeds are allocated to subordinated tranches based on their defined return profiles.
          The junior tranche receives the remaining proceeds and bears first-loss risk in case of defaults.

       2. **Subordination Ratio**: Each tranche (except the junior tranche) has a subordination ratio, determining the percentage of the asset pool covered by subordinated tranches below it.
          For example, a senior tranche with a 20% subordination ratio must be protected by subordinated tranches accounting for at least 20% of the total asset pool.

       3. **Implicit Leverage of the Junior Tranche**: The junior tranche bears first-loss risk but typically benefits from higher variable returns.
          It captures excess returns not allocated to fixed-rate tranches above it, resulting in potentially significant returns.
          This allows the junior tranche to have an implicit leverage effect.

       4. **On-Chain Implementation**: Centrifuge Protocol allows flexible configuration of multiple tranches within a pool, ranging from one to five tranches.
          Cash drag refers to the situation where liquidity in the reserve does not earn interest, reducing overall returns.
          Cash drag is distributed across tranches in revolving pools, affecting returns accordingly.
          Breaching subordination ratios can lead to certain transactions being blocked until the ratio is restored.

       5. **Handling of Defaults**: Write-downs and write-offs resulting from defaults are absorbed by the junior tranche as long as it exists.
          This reduces the value of the junior tranche and token price, impacting junior returns.
          The pool continues to function normally as long as all subordination ratios remain intact.

       6. **Two-Tiered Structure for Ethereum Pools: DROP and TIN**: For Ethereum pools created before May 2023, the implementation consists of a two-tiered structure.
          The senior tranche is referred to as DROP, and the junior tranche is referred to as TIN.
          Each pool has a defined "Drop Subordination" or "Minimum TIN ratio."

    5. **Pool Valuation (NAV)**:

       1. **Introduction to Asset Valuation**: Defines asset valuation as the process of determining the current worth of an asset or portfolio, often expressed as the net asset value (NAV).
          Explains the need for asset valuation when selling assets or entering/exiting investment funds or pools.

       2. **Approaches to Asset Valuation**: Discusses different approaches to valuing assets based on their asset class.
          Highlights the challenge of valuing illiquid assets, which are common in private credit and often financed through the Centrifuge protocol.
          Mentions valuation methods such as "marked to model" and the discounted cash flow (DCF) method.

       3. **On-chain Implementation**: Describes how the Centrifuge Protocol is agnostic to asset classes and can accommodate various valuation methodologies.
          Explains that the chosen valuation method can be configured on a per-pool basis based on the asset class.
          Mentions the use of DCF-based approaches and "marking at par" as current implementations.

       4. **From Asset Values to Pool Values**: Explains that asset valuation within the Centrifuge Protocol is conducted on a per-asset level.States that the sum of the values of individual assets equals the portfolio value, and together with the pool reserve, it determines the pool value.

       5. **From Valuation to Token Prices**: Discusses how changes in the pool value primarily impact the most junior tranche of a pool. Mentions that senior tokens accrue value at a fixed rate and explains that junior tranches capture both excess returns and losses through defaults.

       6. **Handling of Write-offs and Write-downs**: Describes how Centrifuge allows for flexible handling of defaults through write-offs and write-downs.
          Explains that write-offs and write-downs only impact the most junior tranche of a pool.

       7. **Introduction to "DCF" Valuation**: Introduces the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation methodology.
          Provides an overview of the DCF valuation process, which includes deriving expected cash flows, risk adjustment for credit risk, and discounting cash flows to determine present values.

       8. **Simple Numerical Example**: Presents a numerical example of calculating the present value of a single cash flow using the DCF method. Lists assumed asset parameters and valuation assumptions.
          Walks through the calculations for the expected cash flow, adjusting for default risk, and discounting the risk-adjusted cash flow.

    6. **Multiple Currency Support**:Centrifuge Liquidity Pools are designed to accommodate deposits in various currencies.
       Each Liquidity Pool is associated with a specific currency (asset) and a tranche token (share).
       Multiple Liquidity Pools can be deployed, all linked to the same tranche token (share).
       To enable this functionality, the Liquidity Pool contract implements ERC20 methods, allowing interaction with the underlying share implementation.
       ERC2771 context is used in the ERC20 implementation of the tranche token, making sure that all Liquidity Pools are recognized as trusted forwarders.

       1. **Challenges in Supporting Multiple Currencies**: One challenge in supporting multiple currencies is that the decimal precision between the tranche token (based on the native pool currency) and the investment currency (or asset) can vary.
          To address this, all price calculations and conversions between shares and assets (or tranche tokens and currencies) are normalized to 18 decimal fixed-point integers.Calculations are performed using these normalized values, and then the results are unnormalized back to their intended decimal precision.
          Notably, currencies with more than 18 decimals are not supported and are blocked in the contracts.

    7. **Centrifuge Token Executive**

       1. **Abstract**: The Centrifuge Token Model underpins the Centrifuge platform, eliminating the need for centralized third parties to enhance its utility.
          CFG (Centrifuge Governance Token) plays a central role by enabling transaction fees, staking value, and on-chain governance.

       2. **CFG Utility**: CFG tokens serve various Centrifuge-specific utilities, including network functions, transaction fees, on-chain governance, and functionality to finance real-world assets on-chain.
          As the utility of Centrifuge grows, CFG captures value through transaction fees and governance.

       3. **Token Supply**: CFG token supply increases in the short term to pay for chain security and incentivize network agents through CFG Network Rewards.
          Mint rates can be adjusted down by CFG holders as network utility increases.

       4. **Burning Mechanisms**: A portion of transaction fees will be burned, helping balance the total token supply over time.

       5. **CFG Token Distribution**: Initial distribution created 400,000,000 CFG tokens, distributed to the Foundation and initial contributors. Ongoing distribution through rewards for chain security and adoption.
          Widespread token distribution promotes decentralization.

       6. **Token Lockups**: CFG tokens have long-term lockups to align holders' incentives with the long-term growth of the Centrifuge ecosystem. Core team members, sales, and rewards are subject to lockups.

       7. **Governance**: CFG tokens are essential for standard network functions and technical governance.
          CFG holders participate in governance through on-chain voting on proposals.
          Transaction fees paid in CFG contribute to the on-chain treasury, which can be distributed or burned as determined by CFG token holder governance.

3.  **Graphical Analysis**: Solidity-metrics is a popular tool used to analyze and visualize Solidity code. It provides various metrics and visualizations to gain insights into the codebase's complexity and maintainability.
    [solidity-metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics)

4.  **Utilizing Static Analysis Tools**: During the static analysis phase, I initiated the Slither tool. The initial run of Slither on the contract led to the identification of some vulnerabilities. Notably,some of these vulnerabilities align with known issues categorized under `BotRace` and alot of this vulnerabilities have false. The result of the Slither analysis indicated the presence of both false positives and negatives.

5.  **Test Coverage Evaluation**: During this phase, I play with the tests, initially encountering challenges when attempting to run them first. However, after resolving the issues, I found the well-written tests to be quite interesting.

6.  **Manuel Code Review** In this phase, I initially conducted a line-by-line analysis, following that, I engaged in a comparison mode, Despite the complexity of this codebase, with its heavy mathematical elements, I didn't come across any noteworthy insights during the first two modes. Consequently, I shifted my focus to the Blackboxing mode.

    - **Line by Line Analysis**: Pay close attention to the contract's intended functionality and compare it with its actual behavior on a line-by-line basis.

    - **Comparison Mode**: Compare the implementation of each function with established standards or existing implementations, focusing on the function names to identify any deviations.

    - **Blackboxing Mode**: Particularly useful for complex codebases. Grasp the protocol's expected behavior through tests, and experiment with them to better understand and navigate the intricacies of the code.

# [A-02] Architecture recommendations

The following architecture improvements and feedback could be considered:

1. **Decentralized Governance**: Centrifuge's governance mechanism relies on CFG token holders to make decisions. Implement a decentralized governance system that allows token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades.

   `Recommendation`: Utilize a blockchain-based governance framework, such as DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), that allows token holders to participate in governance decisions securely and transparently.

2. **On-Chain Net Asset Value (NAV) Calculation**: Create an efficient and accurate on-chain NAV calculation mechanism that considers various loan types, defaults, and asset valuations.

   `Recommendation`: Implement a robust pricing and valuation engine on-chain. Use oracles and trusted data sources to gather information for accurate NAV calculations. Consider implementing DCF models for pricing illiquid assets.

3. **Flexible Tranching System**: Create a flexible tranching system that allows for different risk and return profiles within the same asset class. Ensure that tranches are customizable and can be adapted to specific use cases.

   `Recommendation`: Design contracts that support the creation of multiple tranches within a pool. Allow issuers to define tranche characteristics, including risk levels and yield profiles.

4. **Shared Security as a Parachain**: Leverage the shared security model provided by Polkadot's parachain architecture. This ensures that Centrifuge Chain benefits from the security of the Polkadot network while focusing on its specific use case.

   `Recommendation`: Establish a strong connection to the Polkadot relay chain and regularly monitor and update security protocols to align with the latest Polkadot enhancements

5. **Forkless Upgrades**: Leverage Substrate's forkless upgrade mechanism to enable seamless and non-disruptive protocol upgrades.

   `Recommendation`: Establish a protocol upgrade schedule and communicate upgrades to the community in advance. Test upgrades thoroughly in a development environment before deploying them on the mainnet.

6. **Revolving Pool Logic**: Implement the revolving pool logic to allow investors to lock investments and redemptions at any time. Ensure that the decentralized solver mechanism can match investments and redemptions efficiently while maintaining risk metrics.

7. **Interest Rates and Fees**: Establish transparent and configurable interest rates and fees for financings within the pool. Provide clear explanations of how these rates are calculated and how they affect returns.

8. **Subordination Ratios**: Develop a mechanism for setting and maintaining subordination ratios for each tranche. This mechanism should prevent transactions that would breach these ratios and trigger corrective actions.

9. **Waterfall Logic**: Implement the logic for the waterfall distribution of returns and losses among different tranches. This logic should ensure that senior tranches are prioritized in receiving returns and are protected from losses.

10. **Flexible Epoch Duration**: Implement a parameter that allows the issuer to define the minimum duration of an epoch flexibly. This parameter should be adjustable, enabling different epoch durations (e.g., daily or monthly epochs) to suit various pool requirements.

11. **Portfolio Valuation**: Implement a mechanism to calculate the portfolio value by summing up the present values of risk-adjusted expected cash flows for all assets in the pool. This should also consider the liquidity reserve associated with the pool.

12. **Input Rate Conversion**: Develop a function that converts APR (Annual Percentage Rate) to the appropriate on-chain format for interest rate calculations. This conversion should consider the compounding frequency (e.g., seconds in a year) to ensure consistency between input rates and on-chain calculations.

13. **APR to APY Conversion**: Implement a function that calculates the APY (Annual Percentage Yield) from the APR. This is crucial for displaying meaningful interest rates to users, especially when compounding occurs more frequently than annually.

14. **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Management**: Implement mechanisms for creating and managing SPVs. SPVs play a crucial role in isolating financial risk and ensuring that the assets remain separate from the Asset Originator's business activities. Automation can streamline SPV setup and management.

15. **KYC/AML Integration**: Build robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes into the onboarding of investors. These processes should align with regulatory requirements and be handled efficiently by the Asset Originator.

16. **Whitelisting and Wallet Integration**: Create mechanisms for whitelisting investor wallet addresses in Centrifuge. This integration should be part of the subscription process and should be managed by the SPV.

17. **Tokenization of Investments**: Implement tokenization mechanisms for Senior and Junior tokens, allowing investors to easily purchase these tokens using stablecoins. Ensure that these tokens align with the legal agreements and regulatory requirements.

18. **Redemption and Liquidation Procedures**: Develop clear procedures for investors to redeem their Senior and Junior tokens. Define the conditions under which redemptions can occur and ensure that these procedures are enforced by smart contracts.

19. **CFG Utility**: Clearly define the utility of CFG tokens within the Centrifuge ecosystem. This includes their use for transaction fees, staking, and participation in on-chain governance. Ensure that CFG tokens have real and meaningful functions that incentivize users to acquire and hold them.

20. **Rewards and Incentives**: Design a reward system that incentivizes early network participants and contributors. CFG rewards should be attractive enough to encourage users to perform critical network functions, such as running nodes and participating in governance.

21. **Token Lockups**: Implement token lockup periods for CFG tokens to align the incentives of token holders with the long-term growth of the Centrifuge ecosystem. Ensure that core team members, investors, and participants in CFG sales have lockup periods in place.

22. **Epoch Mechanism**: Implement an epoch mechanism for asynchronous deposits and redemptions. This mechanism should ensure fair and efficient processing of transactions, especially when dealing with cross-chain interactions. Consider optimizing transaction batching to minimize gas costs.

23. **Emergency Response**: Prepare for emergency scenarios, such as malicious messages or actions by external actors. Design and document procedures for handling emergencies, including pause mechanisms and timelocks to prevent unauthorized changes.

4.  **Escrow.sol**: The contract to hold and manage approvals for tokens. to handling of token approvals is crucial. The Auth contract, from which it inherits, provides access control to ensure that only authorized entities can approve token spending.

    - **Constructor**: The constructor is called when the contract is deployed. It sets the deployer's address as a ward (an entity with special privileges) and emits a Rely event to indicate that the deployer has special access rights.

    - **Token Approvals**: The contract provides an approve function that allows for the approval of tokens. This function is marked with the auth modifier, which means that only authorized entities (wards) can call it. Inside the function, it uses the SafeTransferLib to safely approve the spender to spend tokens up to the specified value. After the approval is successful, an Approve event is emitted to log the approval event.

5.  **UserEscrow.sol**: Is designed to securely hold tokens and facilitate controlled transfers to designated destinations. It helps manage and restrict token movements based on predefined allowances and permissions, making it useful for various DApps and protocols.

    - **Constructor**: The constructor is called when the contract is deployed. It sets the deployer's address as a ward (an entity with special privileges) and emits a Rely event to indicate that the deployer has special access rights.

    - **Token Transfers**: The contract provides two functions for token transfers:
      `transferIn`: This function allows authorized entities (wards) to transfer tokens into the escrow for a specific destination. It increases the designated amount for the destination and emits a TransferIn event to log the transfer.
      `transferOut`: This function allows authorized entities (wards) to transfer tokens from the escrow to a specified receiver. It checks that the destination has sufficient designated tokens, and the receiver has an appropriate allowance to receive the tokens. If the conditions are met, it transfers the tokens and emits a TransferOut event.

6.  **Root.sol**: The Root contract is a critical component for managing access control and governance in the system. It provides features for pausing contracts, timelocking ward management, and managing ward permissions on external contracts.

    - **Constructor**: The constructor is called when the contract is deployed. It takes two parameters: \_escrow (an address) and \_delay (a uint256). It initializes the escrow variable with the provided address and sets the delay variable with the provided delay value. It also designates the deployer's address as a ward and emits a Rely event to indicate that the deployer has special access rights.

    - **Administration**: The file function allows authorized entities (wards) to change the value of the delay state variable. It checks if the provided data is within the maximum allowed delay and updates the delay accordingly. It emits a File event to log the change.

    - **Pause Management**: The contract provides functions pause and unpause for authorized entities (wards) to pause and unpause the contract. The paused state variable is updated accordingly, and events (Pause and Unpause) are emitted to log these actions.

    - **Timelocked Ward Management**: The contract provides functions for timelocked ward management:
      scheduleRely: Allows authorized entities (wards) to schedule ward permissions for a specific target contract. It records the scheduled time when the permissions will be granted and emits a RelyScheduled event.

      addPauser: Allows authorized entities (wards) to add a pauser by setting their value to 1 in the pausers mapping. It emits an AddPauser event.
      removePauser: Allows authorized entities (wards) to remove a pauser by setting their value to 0 in the pausers mapping. It emits a RemovePauser event.

    - **Admin Actions**:

      The contract provides a function called pause. This function can be called by any address with pausing authority (as indicated by the canPause modifier). When called, it invokes the pause function on the Root contract (represented by the root state variable). This function essentially allows authorized users to pause certain functionality within the Root contract.

8.  **DelayedAdmin.sol**: The contract is an interface for authorized addresses (wards) to trigger certain administrative actions on the Root contract, such as pausing, unpausing, scheduling, and canceling rely actions. This contract provides a controlled way to manage these actions within the system, ensuring that only authorized parties can execute them.

    - **State Variables**: Root public immutable root: This state variable is an immutable public address representing an instance of the Root contract. The Root contract is expected to have functions related to pausing, unpausing, scheduling, and canceling rely actions.

    - **Admin Actions**: The contract provides functions for various administrative actions:
      pause: Allows any address with ward access to call the pause function on the Root contract. This function effectively pauses certain functionality within the Root contract.
      unpause: Allows any address with ward access to call the unpause function on the Root contract. This function reverses the pause action and resumes functionality within the Root contract.
      scheduleRely: Allows any address with ward access to call the scheduleRely function on the Root contract. This function is used to schedule a rely action on the Root contract, which may involve time-based execution.
      cancelRely: Allows any address with ward access to call the cancelRely function on the Root contract. This function cancels a previously scheduled rely action on the Root contract

9.  **Tranche.sol**: This contract extends the ERC20 standard by implementing transfer restrictions and allowing for trusted liquidity pools. It relies on the `restrictionManager` to enforce these restrictions, and authorized addresses can manage trusted liquidity pools. Additionally, the contract includes ERC2771Context support to handle trusted forwarders.

    - **State Variables**:

      ERC1404Like public restrictionManager: This state variable represents an instance of the ERC1404Like contract. It is used to manage transfer restrictions for the token.
      mapping(address => bool) public liquidityPools: This mapping keeps track of trusted liquidity pools. It maps an address to a boolean value, indicating whether the address is a trusted liquidity pool.

    - **Modifier**:

      This modifier is used to restrict certain functions based on transfer restrictions defined by the restrictionManager. It checks whether the detected transfer restriction code equals the SUCCESS_CODE provided by the restrictionManager.

    - **Administration Functions**:

      file: This function allows an authorized address to modify the restrictionManager address. It is used to update the contract's restriction manager.
      addLiquidityPool and removeLiquidityPool: These functions allow authorized addresses to add or remove addresses as trusted liquidity pools.

    - **Restrictions Functions**:

      transfer, transferFrom, and mint: These functions override the corresponding functions in the ERC20 standard and apply the restricted modifier to enforce transfer restrictions.

    - **ERC1404 Interface Functions**:

      detectTransferRestriction, checkTransferRestriction, messageForTransferRestriction, and SUCCESS_CODE: These functions implement the ERC1404 interface for detecting and managing transfer restrictions.

    - **ERC2771Context Functions**:

      isTrustedForwarder: Checks if a given address is a trusted forwarder (a liquidity pool).
      \_msgSender: Overrides the \_msgSender function to handle trusted forwarders when using the ERC2771Context.

10. **RestrictionManager.sol**: The `RestrictionManager` contract is used to manage membership-based transfer restrictions. It allows the contract owner and authorized addresses to update and check the membership status of users. If a user is not a member (i.e., their membership has expired), transfers to their address will be restricted, and a specific error message will be provided.

    - **State Variables**:

      uint8 public constant SUCCESS_CODE: A constant representing a successful transfer code.
      uint8 public constant DESTINATION_NOT_A_MEMBER_RESTRICTION_CODE: A constant representing a restriction code for transfers to non-members.
      string public constant SUCCESS_MESSAGE: A constant success message.
      string public constant DESTINATION_NOT_A_MEMBER_RESTRICTION_MESSAGE: A constant message for the "destination not a member" restriction.
      mapping(address => uint256) public members: A mapping that associates user addresses with timestamps indicating their membership validity.

    - **Constructor**:

      The constructor initializes the contract, granting the deployer (msg.sender) authorization by setting wards[msg.sender] to 1.

    - **ERC1404 Implementation**:

      detectTransferRestriction: This function checks whether a transfer from from to to with a value of value is allowed based on membership status. If the destination (to) is not a member, it returns the DESTINATION_NOT_A_MEMBER_RESTRICTION_CODE; otherwise, it returns the SUCCESS_CODE.
      messageForTransferRestriction: This function returns the corresponding message for a given restriction code. It provides specific messages for the "destination not a member" restriction and the success code.

    - **Checking Members**:

      member: This function checks if a user is a member by verifying that their membership timestamp is greater than or equal to the current block timestamp. If not, it reverts with an error message.
      hasMember: This function checks if a user is a member by returning true if their membership timestamp is greater than or equal to the current block timestamp; otherwise, it returns false.

    - **Updating Members**:

      updateMember: This function allows authorized addresses (ward) to update a user's membership status. It sets the membership timestamp for the specified user to the provided validUntil timestamp. It reverts if the validUntil timestamp is in the past.
      updateMembers: This function allows multiple users' membership statuses to be updated simultaneously. It iterates over an array of user addresses and calls updateMember for each user.

11. **Gateway.sol**: This contract is an intermediary between various contracts and routers, enabling controlled communication between different components of the system. It enforces access control, pausing functionality, and message formatting to facilitate interactions with other contracts.

    - **Constructor**: The contract's constructor initializes several state variables, including references to the Root contract (for pausing functionality), InvestmentManager, PoolManager, and an outgoingRouter contract. It also sets the sender (msg.sender) as an authorized entity (ward) to make administrative changes.

    - **Modifiers**:

      onlyInvestmentManager: This modifier restricts the calling of certain functions to the InvestmentManager contract.
      onlyPoolManager: This modifier restricts the calling of certain functions to the PoolManager contract.
      onlyIncomingRouter: This modifier restricts the calling of certain functions to authorized incoming routers.
      pauseable: This modifier ensures that the contract's functions can only be executed when the Root contract is not in a paused state.

    - **Administration**:

      The contract allows authorized users to change the references to the InvestmentManager, PoolManager, and outgoingRouter using the file function.
      Users with administrative privileges can add and remove incoming routers, as well as update the outgoing router.

    - **Outgoing Functions**: The contract provides functions to send various messages (transactions) to external contracts. These functions encode the messages based on specific message formats before sending them to the outgoingRouter.

      Example functions include transferTrancheTokensToCentrifuge, transferTrancheTokensToEVM, transfer, increaseInvestOrder, decreaseInvestOrder, increaseRedeemOrder, and more.

    - **Incoming Message Handling**: The contract has a function named handle that is intended to parse and handle incoming messages from authorized incoming routers. The incoming messages can include commands to add pools, add currencies, update members, execute transfers, and interact with the InvestmentManager and PoolManager.

    - **Helper Function**:

      \_addressToBytes32: An internal function that converts an Ethereum address to a bytes32 type. This conversion is used when formatting certain messages.

12. **Messages.sol**: This library provides a structured way to work with different types of messages within the contract, making it easier to encode, decode, and process data sent to the contract.

    - **Enums**: The library defines two enums: Call and Domain. The Call enum represents different types of messages that can be sent to the contract, and the Domain enum represents different domains (Centrifuge and EVM).

    - **Functions**: The library defines a series of functions for formatting, parsing, and checking the type of messages. Here are some key functions:

      messageType(bytes memory \_msg): Determines the type of a message based on the first byte of the message.

      Functions for formatting and parsing specific message types, such as AddCurrency, AddPool, AllowPoolCurrency, and others.

      Functions for formatting and parsing messages related to transfers, investment orders, redeem orders, and upgrades.

      Functions for updating tranche token metadata and investment limits.

    - **Message Format**: Each message type has a specific format defined, where the data is packed into a bytes array in a specific order. For example, the AddCurrency message contains the currency ID and its Ethereum address.

    - **String Handling**: The code includes functions for converting strings to fixed-size byte arrays, as Solidity does not natively support dynamic strings in storage.

    - **Domain Handling**: The Domain enum is used to distinguish between messages related to Centrifuge and EVM domains, which can be important for routing messages correctly within the smart contract.

    - **Upgrade Mechanism**: The library includes functions for scheduling and canceling contract upgrades. This is a common feature in smart contracts to allow for future updates and improvements.

13. **Router.sol**: the AxelarRouter contract is a routing and validation mechanism for messages between different networks, specifically targeting the Axelar Centrifuge chain. It integrates with an external gateway contract (gateway) and communicates with the Axelar Gateway contract (axelarGateway) to ensure the secure transfer of messages.

    - **Contract Variables**:

      axelarCentrifugeChainId, axelarCentrifugeChainAddress, and centrifugeGatewayPrecompileAddress are private constant strings used as identifiers for specific chains and addresses within those chains.
      AxelarGatewayLike public immutable axelarGateway is a state variable representing an instance of the AxelarGatewayLike interface. It is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after deployment.

    - **Gateway Variable**:

      GatewayLike public gateway is a state variable that holds an instance of a contract that implements the GatewayLike interface. This contract is set through the file function.

    - **Constructor**:

      The constructor takes an axelarGateway\_ address as an argument and initializes the axelarGateway variable with the provided address.
      It also sets the deployer of the contract as an authorized entity (ward) and emits a Rely event.

    - **Modifiers**:

      onlyCentrifugeChainOrigin: This modifier restricts the execution of certain functions to only be allowed when called from the Axelar Gateway (axelarGateway) and when the source chain and source address match predefined values.
      onlyGateway: This modifier restricts the execution of certain functions to only be allowed when called from the gateway contract.

    - **Administration Functions**: file: This function is used to set the gateway contract. It can be called by authorized addresses (those with sufficient "ward" permissions). If the provided parameter is not recognized, it reverts.

    - **Incoming Functions**:

      execute: This function handles incoming messages from the Axelar Gateway. It verifies the message's authenticity and approval using the axelarGateway contract's validateContractCall function and then delegates the handling of the payload to the gateway contract.

    - **Outgoing Functions**:

      send: This function is used to send messages to the Axelar Gateway. It calls the callContract function of the axelarGateway contract.

14. **Auth.sol**: The contract provides a basic authentication mechanism for managing permissions. It allows designated addresses to grant and revoke permissions for specific actions in other contracts by modifying the wards mapping.

    - **Copyright Notice**: There is a copyright notice that credits Centrifuge and mentions that this code is based on the MakerDAO dss (Dai Stablecoin System) code, which implies that this contract is adapted from the MakerDAO codebase.

    - **State Variable**:

      mapping(address => uint256) public wards: This mapping stores addresses and their associated permission status. If wards[user] is set to 1, it means the user has permission; if it's set to 0, the user does not have permission.

    - **Events**:

      event Rely(address indexed user): This event is emitted when permissions are granted to a user. It logs the address of the user who was granted permissions.
      event Deny(address indexed user): This event is emitted when permissions are removed from a user. It logs the address of the user from whom permissions were revoked.

    - **Functions**:

      rely(address user) external auth: This function is used to grant permissions to a user. It takes an address (user) as an argument and sets the associated wards[user] value to 1, indicating that the user has permission. This function can only be called by an authorized entity (as indicated by the auth modifier).
      deny(address user) external auth: This function is used to revoke permissions from a user. It takes an address (user) as an argument and sets the associated wards[user] value to 0, indicating that the user no longer has permission. Like the rely function, this function can only be called by an authorized entity.

    - **Modifier**:

      modifier auth(): This modifier is used to restrict access to functions. Functions with this modifier can only be executed by addresses that have been granted permission (i.e., wards[msg.sender] is set to 1). If the sender does not have permission, the function call will revert with the error message "Auth/not-authorized." 15. **Context.sol**:

# [A-04] Centralization risks

1.  **LiquidityPool.sol**

    - **Ownership and Permissions**: The contract uses the Auth contract to manage permissions. Addresses with permissions (wards) can perform critical functions in the contract, such as changing the `investmentManager`. If the owner or authorized administrators abuse their power or lose control of their keys, it could lead to centralization risks.

    - **Permit Functionality**: The contract includes functions (requestDepositWithPermit and requestRedeemWithPermit) that allow users to provide permit signatures for deposit and redemption requests. This introduces trust in the permit-signing process and could lead to centralization if permit signatures are misused.

    - **Delegation of Approval**: Some functions in the contract require the approval of an owner. While this is a common mechanism, it can introduce centralization if a few individuals or entities have the authority to approve or deny requests.

2.  **InvestmentManager.sol**

    - **PoolManager Dependency**: Similarly, the contract depends on the PoolManagerLike contract, which could potentially centralize control over which liquidity pools are supported and other configuration settings.

    - **Ownership**: The wards mapping in the constructor gives ownership to the deploying address, which can centralize control over contract upgrades and modifications.

3.  **PoolManager.sol**

    - **Pool Management**: The contract owner has the authority to manage pools, add new currencies, and deploy tranches and liquidity pools. This central authority could lead to issues if the owner becomes malicious or incompetent. Consider implementing a decentralized governance mechanism or multi-signature control to mitigate this risk.

    - **Currency Addition**: The ability to add new currencies to the system is centralized. If the contract owner can unilaterally add currencies, there's a risk of adding malicious or unstable tokens. Implementing a community-driven or decentralized process for adding currencies can reduce this risk.
    - **Memberlist Management**: The contract allows the contract owner to update members in the memberlist for tranches. This control can be centralized and could lead to unfair or discriminatory actions.

4.  **Root.sol**

    - **Delay Control**: The contract allows the administrator to modify the delay value, which determines the time delay required for certain administrative actions to take effect. If the delay is set to a very long duration or if the administrator can change it without restrictions, it could lead to extended centralization and potential misuse of powers.

    - **Arbitrary Ward Permissions**: The contract enables the administrator to grant or deny ward permissions to external contracts and users without requiring the approval of any other parties. This feature could potentially be abused or misused if not carefully managed.

5.  **PauseAdmin.sol**

    - **Instantaneous Pausing**: Any user who is designated as a pauser can instantly pause the "Root" contract. While this is intended for emergency situations, it also means that the system can be paused rapidly and without checks and balances. This could lead to centralization if pausers misuse this power.

6.  **ERC20.sol**

    - **Permit Function**: The permit function allows a user to approve a spender using a signed message. While this can be useful for gas-efficient approval, it introduces centralization risks if the signed message can be manipulated or if a malicious actor gains control over a user's private key.

7.  **Gateway.sol**

    - **Router Control**: The contract maintains a list of incoming routers, which have the ability to send messages to the contract. The centralization risk here is that the contract relies on a centralized set of routers. If these routers are controlled by a single entity or a limited group, it can lead to centralization of message handling

    - **Pauseable Functionality**: The contract checks if the Root contract is paused before forwarding messages. If the Root contract's pause status can be controlled centrally, it could lead to the centralization of the contract's functionality.

# [A-05] Systemic risks

1. **Liquidity Risk**: Revolving pools allow for continuous investments and redemptions. However, if there is insufficient liquidity to fulfill redemption requests, it could lead to delays or difficulties for investors in withdrawing their capital.

2. **Dependency on a Custom Blockchain**: While having a blockchain custom-built for Real World Assets (RWA) offers advantages, it introduces the risk of dependency on a single infrastructure. Any vulnerabilities or issues in Centrifuge Chain could disrupt the entire ecosystem, affecting users and assets.

3. **Governance Token Dual Use**: The CFG token serves dual roles for both governance and transaction fees. This dual use may create conflicts of interest between token holders seeking to influence governance decisions and those using the token for transaction fee purposes.

4. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: The reliance on real-world legal structures and processes introduces legal and regulatory risks. Changes in regulations, legal disputes, or non-compliance could have significant implications for the operation of the SPV and the protocol as a whole.

5. **Asset Recovery Complexity**: The process for recovering capital in the event of asset defaults can be complex and resource-intensive. The success of recovery efforts depends on various factors, including the asset class and the effectiveness of the issuer's strategies. Delays or difficulties in asset recovery could impact the performance of the pool and token holders.

6. **Counterparty Risk**: The protocol relies on issuers to recover capital from defaulted assets. If issuers are unable to effectively manage and recover defaulted assets, it could lead to losses for investors. Assessing the creditworthiness and capabilities of issuers is crucial to mitigating this risk.

7. **Tax Compliance**: Tax form submissions are mentioned in the onboarding process. Handling tax-related matters correctly is essential to avoid potential tax liabilities for both investors and the protocol. Tax regulations can be complex and subject to change.

8. **Complex Tranche Structure**: While the tranching system allows investors to choose different risk-return profiles, it also introduces complexity. Investors need a clear understanding of the risks associated with each tranche, and the interplay between tranches can lead to challenges in portfolio management.

9. **Market Risk**: The value of the Junior token, which carries higher risk, can be affected by asset defaults and changes in the NAV. Investors in the Junior tranche are exposed to market fluctuations and potential losses.

10. **Dependency on CFG Rewards**: The protocol incentivizes investors with CFG rewards. However, the value of CFG can be volatile, and the rewards are not guaranteed. Changes in CFG value can affect the attractiveness of the investment.

11. **Tranche Structure Complexity**: While tiered investment structures offer customization for risk and return profiles, they also introduce complexity. Investors must understand the nuances of each tranche, including their position in the waterfall and subordination ratios. Complexity can lead to misjudgment and investment decisions that do not align with an investor's risk tolerance.

12. **Cash Drag**: Liquidity in the reserve does not earn interest, resulting in cash drag. This affects the effective returns of all tranches, as the reserve's cash reduces the overall return on the portfolio. Investors may not always be aware of the impact of cash drag on their returns.

13. **Breach of Subordination Ratios**: The subordination ratios are essential for protecting senior and mezzanine tranches against defaults. Breaching these ratios can lead to restrictions on transactions, potentially disrupting the normal functioning of the pool. Restoring subordination ratios may require additional investments or asset sales.

14. **Token Price Volatility**: The system's reliance on token prices for executing transactions at the end of each epoch exposes investors to price volatility risk. Sudden price fluctuations can impact the value of investments and redemptions.

15. **Tranche Debt Rebalancing**: The rebalancing of tranche debt based on the Tranche Ratio introduces an additional layer of complexity. Errors in this process could lead to discrepancies in interest accrued and tranche values.

16. **Token Weights and Prioritization**: The documentation mentions assigning weights to different transaction types for optimization purposes. Incorrectly weighted transactions could lead to suboptimal execution and disputes among investors.

17. **Challenging Period**: The 30-minute challenging period introduces competition among participants to submit superior solutions. This could create a rush to submit solutions and potential disputes if multiple solutions are proposed simultaneously.

18. **Overreliance on Models**: Depending too heavily on models like the DCF method can lead to risks associated with model assumptions. Additionally, models may not capture all relevant factors affecting an asset's value.

19. **Vulnerability to Voter Apathy**: On-chain governance relies on active participation from CFG token holders to vote on proposals. There is a risk of voter apathy, where a majority of token holders do not participate in governance decisions. This could result in decisions being made by a small, engaged minority, potentially leading to decisions that do not align with the broader community's interests.

20. **Token Supply Manipulation Risk**: The document mentions that mint rates can be adjusted down by a vote of CFG holders as the network's utility increases. However, this mechanism carries a risk of manipulation, where a select group of token holders may collude to manipulate supply dynamics to their advantage, potentially affecting the token's value and network stability.

21. **Long-Term Lockup Risk**: While token lockups are intended to align incentives with the long-term growth of the ecosystem, they also pose a risk. If a significant portion of CFG tokens are locked up for an extended period, it can limit liquidity in the market, making it challenging for token holders to buy or sell CFG when needed.
