[NC-01] -- In liquidityPool.sol modifier `withApproval` has wrong comments.
```/// @dev Either msg.sender is the owner or a ward on the contract
    modifier withApproval(address owner) {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "LiquidityPool/no-approval");
        _;
    }
```
The intent here is to only check if `msg.sender == owner` but the comment says
 >`Either msg.sender is the owner or a ward on the contract`

the comment should be updated with 

>`check msg.sender is the owner`.
