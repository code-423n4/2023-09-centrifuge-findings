Lack of Proper Documentation
Impact: Lack of clear and comprehensive documentation can make it challenging for developers and auditors to understand the code's intent and functionality.

Recommended Mitigation Steps: Add detailed comments explaining the purpose of functions, variables, and important logic in the code. This will improve code readability and make it easier to audit.
