- Comments for the judge to contextualize my findings.
I included permalinks in each report to help you find the exact lines of code.

- Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
I used a critical approach on the codebase to find key areas that could impact the project if they were exploited like external calls and transactions.

- Risks
The return value of external calls are unchecked. This can cause serious problems if the call reverts.
